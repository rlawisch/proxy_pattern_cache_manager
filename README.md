# Proxy Pattern example - Cache Manager

This project is a simple cache manager implementation to demonstrate the benefits provided by the [Proxy pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_pattern). It checks if a given request result is on cache and still valid before calling a slower method to process it.
It is made in Python 3.10 with 0 dependencies to install. Running is as simple as `python3 src/main.py`.

Pull requests with new features, refactors, better/more complete implementations, exception handling and/or better coverage of edge cases are very welcome!
